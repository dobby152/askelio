# üé® ASKELIO - UX/UI Redesign Instructions for AI Implementation

## üìã Mission Statement

**Current Problem**: The Askelio frontend works but looks outdated and lacks modern user experience patterns that users expect from premium SaaS applications.

**Your Task**: Transform the existing functional application into a modern, visually appealing, and intuitive platform while preserving ALL existing functionality and API integrations.

**Success Criteria**: Users should feel they're using a premium, modern SaaS tool that's both beautiful and highly functional.

### **2. Visual Hierarchy & Clarity**
- Most important elements should be largest and most prominent
- Related information should be grouped together visually
- Actions should be placed where users expect them
- Text should be scannable with clear headings and sections

### **3. Smooth Interactions**
- All clickable elements should provide immediate visual feedback
- Transitions between states should feel smooth and natural
- Success actions should feel celebratory
- Errors should be helpful and suggest solutions

### **4. Mobile-Friendly Design**
- All interfaces should work well on phones and tablets

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Page-by-Page Layout Requirements

### **üè† Dashboard Page (/dashboard)**

**Current Issues**: Basic layout with simple cards, lacks visual interest and clear hierarchy.

**New Layout Requirements**:
- **Top Section**: Welcome message with user's name, current date/time, and quick stats summary
- **Main Content Area**:
  - Recent documents section (3-4 cards showing latest uploads with thumbnails)

**Key Interactions**:
- Clicking "Upload New Document" should take user to upload page with smooth transition
- Document cards should show hover effects and allow quick preview
- Stats should be interactive (clickable to see details)
- Navigation should highlight current page clearly

### **üì§ Upload Page (/documents/new)**

**Current Issues**: Basic drag-and-drop area, simple progress bar, split-screen layout lacks personality.

**New Layout Requirements**:
- **Hero Section**: Large, inviting upload area in center of screen when no file is selected
  - Clear heading like "Upload Your Invoice or Receipt"
  - Subtext explaining what happens next ("AI will automatically extract all data")
  - Visual upload icon or illustration

  - Each step should have descriptive text and progress percentage
  - Visual feedback showing current step is active
- **Results Layout**: After processing, split into two main areas:
  - **Left Side**: PDF preview with extracted fields highlighted/overlaid
  - **Right Side**: Tabbed interface showing extracted data, ARES information, and export options
- **Action Buttons**: Save, Export, Edit buttons prominently placed and clearly labeled

**Key Interactions**:
- Upload area should respond to drag-over with visual feedback
- Progress should feel engaging, not just a loading bar
- Users should be able to edit extracted data inline
- Success state should feel celebratory

### **üìÑ Documents Page (/documents)**

**Current Issues**: Table-based layout is boring, complex resizable panels are confusing.

**New Layout Requirements**:

  - Page title and document count
  - Search bar prominently placed
  - Filter options (by date, type, status) as buttons or dropdown
  - View toggle (grid/list view)
- **Main Content**:
  - **Grid View**: Cards showing document thumbnails, titles, dates, and status badges
  - **List View**: Compact rows with key information and quick action buttons
  - Each document should show confidence score, processing status, and ARES validation status
- **Quick Actions**:
  - Bulk selection with checkboxes
  - Bulk actions toolbar (export, delete, reprocess)
  - Individual document actions on hover (view, edit, export, delete)
- **Empty State**: When no documents, show helpful message with "Upload Your First Document" button

**Key Interactions**:
- Document cards should have hover effects showing additional options
- Clicking a document should open detailed view or preview
- Search should filter results in real-time
- Bulk actions should be intuitive and provide clear feedback

## üß© Key Component Requirements

### **üß≠ Navigation Sidebar**

**Current Issues**: Too many options, static icons, overwhelming for users.

**New Requirements**:
- **Card Layout**: Each document as a card with thumbnail preview
- **Information Display**:
  - Document title/filename prominently at top
  - Upload date and processing status
  - Confidence score with visual indicator (progress bar or badge)
  - ARES validation status (checkmark if validated)
- **Actions**: Hover to reveal action buttons (View, Edit, Export, Delete)
- **Visual States**: Different styling for processing, completed, error states

### **üéØ Upload Area Component**

**Current Issues**: Basic drag-and-drop doesn't feel engaging or guide users well.

- **File Validation**: Clear error messages if file type/size is wrong
- **Progress Display**: Multi-step progress showing current processing stage
- **Success State**: Clear indication when processing is complete with next steps

### **üìà Progress Indicators**

**Current Issues**: Simple progress bars don't communicate what's happening.

**New Requirements**:

## üìù Final Notes for Implementation

**Remember**: This is about making the existing application more beautiful and user-friendly, not changing how it works. Every current feature must continue to function exactly as it does now, just with a better visual presentation and more intuitive user experience.

**Focus on**: Visual improvements, better information hierarchy, clearer user guidance, and more engaging interactions while preserving all existing functionality.

**Test thoroughly**: Ensure all API integrations, data processing, and export features continue to work perfectly after visual changes are applied.

**Ready for AI implementation!** üöÄ
